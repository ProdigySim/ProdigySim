ðŸ™ƒ Hi I wrote code and I like typescript

ðŸ¤” These are my 2 favorite emoji I think

I used to do reverse engineering and write code for L4D2 competitive servers. It was really fun. Most of my public repos are these.

Now I do full stack engineering with a focus on security and developer tools. I really like TypeScript, and I think React is pretty smart too.
