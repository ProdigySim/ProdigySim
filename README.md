ðŸ™ƒ Hi I wrote code and I like typescript

ðŸ¤” These are my 2 favorite emoji I think

I used to do reverse engineering and write code for L4D2 competitive servers. It was really fun. Most of my public repos are these.

Now I do full stack engineering with a focus on security and developer tools. I really like TypeScript, and I think React is pretty smart too.

#### L4D Tools

- [L4D2 Glow Picker](https://prodigysim.github.io/l4d2-glow-picker/) Graphical UI to customize L4D2 glow colors.
- [L4D2 Spawn Order Simulator](https://prodigysim.github.io/l4d2-spawn-order/) Simulates the L4D2 SI spawn algorithm.
